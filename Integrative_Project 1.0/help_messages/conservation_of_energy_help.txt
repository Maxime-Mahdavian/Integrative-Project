	energy of an object.

	Input the mass in kg, the initial height in meters and the damping of the object.
	The maximum mass is 50 kg and it must be positive.
	The minimum mass is 0.01 kg.
	The maximum initial height is 75 meters and must be positive.
	The minimum initial height is 10 meters.

	The damping is the amount of energy that is lost when the object bounces from the floor.
