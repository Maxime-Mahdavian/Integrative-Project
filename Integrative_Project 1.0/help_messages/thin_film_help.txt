	The table shows the wavelengths that are enhanced and destroyed through this process.

	Input the material and the thickness of the thin films.
	The minimum thickness is 100 nm and the maximum is 1000 nm.

	There is 4 different materials, each with different refractive index n, 
	indicated next to the material.
